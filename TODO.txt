Meaning of the game?
	If you start to go down the wrong path it may not be immediately obvious, but when you do realise it may be impossible to go back
	I looked back on my choices and found I was not where I wanted to be
	And I had no way to try again.

Samu's feedback:

Couldn't do #31 or #34 (guy's face and two-robot dismantling)
#35 took lot of work (spread cogs from one to many)
Slow cog worked well
#35 can get overlapping hearts
#13 and #16 worked well
Improve faces

Phil's feedback:

Couldn't do 21, 23, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, 34, 35.
Change #34!
#33 only has one robot where story has many
#33 has him stalking off
