Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once\nwas a young boy\nand a young girl
isolated 3

And they danced together
simple2 4

And they played together
outsider 8

And for a brief time, they knew love
heart 6

But nothing is simple forever
simple3 10

And two lives are more complex than one
eyes 12

One day they found a broken robot in the woods

They worked hard to fix the robot
line3 6

Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements
diagonals 12

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time
ellipsis 10

And the robot marvelled at the love he saw between the boy and the girl
line2 9

And watched as the boy gave his heart to the girl\nAnd she gave hers to him
heart-swap 8

Suddenly lonely, the robot led them to his old home
cross-simple 16

"Please," he said, "so few of these robots are still active"

"Cannot you fix them all?" he pleaded
sparse 12

For the robot hoped to find a love of his own

But over time the girl had grown tired of the boy and the robots

And left him for another
heart-break 3 4



He fell into a deep depression
squareish 20

And he felt a gaping hole in his soul

The robots worked hard to rebuild the boy's broken heart
