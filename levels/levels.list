Let me tell you a story...
simple

Once\nThere was a young boy\nand a young girl
isolated

And they played together
outsider

And they danced together

And for a brief time, they knew love
heart

But nothing is simple forever
simple3

And two is more complex than one
eyes

One day they found a broken robot in the woods

The robot urged them to fix his friends too
sparse

The robots said "if you truly loved one another..."

"... you would exchange a gift of true worth"

So the boy gave his heart to the girl\nAnd she gave hers to him
heart-swap

But over time the girl grew tired of the boy
heart-break

She said all the things she knew would hurt the most
heart-break2

The robots worked hard to rebuild his broken heart
heart-build

But he was not quite the same after that
