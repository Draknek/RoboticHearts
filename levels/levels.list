Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once\nwas a young boy\nand a young girl
isolated 3

And they danced together
simple2 4

And they played together
outsider 8

And for a brief time, they knew love
heart 6

But nothing is simple forever
simple3 10

And two lives are more complex than one
eyes 11

One day they found a broken robot in the woods
line 9

They worked hard to fix the robot
line3 6

Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements
diagonals 12

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time
ellipsis 10

And the robot marvelled at the love he saw between the boy and the girl
line2 9

And watched as the boy gave his heart to the girl\nAnd she gave hers to him
heart-swap 7

The robot became lonely and led them to his old home
cross-simple 16

"Please," he said, "so few of these robots are still active"
cross4 9

"Cannot you fix them all?" he pleaded
sparse 12

And so they worked to repair the aging robots
cross2 11

The task took weeks

And then months
corner 7

And over time the girl found she had grown tired of the robots
level5 8

And she had also grown tired of the boy
heart-break2 5

And left him for another
heart-break 3 4

In his depression he threw himself into his work
squareish 13

He thought only of the robots to be saved
square 9

Until finally there were no more robots left
diamond2 9

And in return the robots worked hard to rebuild the boy's broken heart
heart-build 15

But something was missing
bigsquare 23

So they gifted him a heart of metal that would never fail
diamond-large 5 3

A mechanical heart made by machines
level7 10 1

A heartless heart that would not love
