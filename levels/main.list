Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once / was a young boy / and a young girl
isolated 3

They did not own much
two 5

But they were the best of friends

#And everything they had was shared between them
#gift 7

#sides 8

#separated 10

They were always playing together, dancing through the trees
outsider-trees 7

#Their friendship filling a hole that neither knew existed
#hole 8

One day they found a broken robot in the woods
line-simpler 3

#They worked hard to fix the robot
#line 8

They worked hard to fix the robot / Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time

#And the robot marvelled at the love he saw blossom between the boy and the girl

And the robot watched as the boy gave his heart to the girl / And she gave hers to him

If only their story could have been so simple...
