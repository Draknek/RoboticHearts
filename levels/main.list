Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once\nwas a young boy\nand a young girl
isolated 3

They did not own much
two 5

But everything they had was shared between them
gift 7

They were the best of friends
reckoner 4

They danced together
outsider 7

And they played together
eyes3 9

And helped one another when in need
sides 8

Their friendship bound them together stronger than any rope
string-short 9

Their love filling a hole that neither knew existed
hole 8

But different people will pull in different directions
separated 10

And nothing is simple forever
eyes2 8

#And for a brief time, they knew love
#heart-simpler 6 -- not interesting

#And two lives are more complex than one
#eyes 11 -- too much too soon?

And two lives are more complex than one
simple3-simpler 8

One day they found a broken robot in the woods
line-simpler 3

#One day they found a broken robot in the woods
#line 8

They worked hard to fix the robot
line3 6

Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements
diagonals 12

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time
line2-simpler 8

#And the robot marvelled at the love he saw between the boy and the girl

And he watched as the boy gave his heart to the girl\nAnd she gave hers to him
heart-swap 7

The robot became lonely and led them to his old home
cross-simple 16

#"Please," he said, "so few of these robots are still active"

"Cannot you fix them all?" he pleaded
cross7 7

And so they worked to repair the aging robots
cross2 7

The task took weeks
ellipsis 10

#And as the boy worked late into the nights, the girl grew lonely
#corner2 13

#And then weeks turned to months

And as the boy worked late into the nights, the girl grew lonely
cross4 9

The boy's neglect of the girl broke her heart
heart-break2 5

And she left him for another
heart-break 3 4

And suddenly the boy noticed her absence and found he was lonely too
bigsquare 16

#In his foolish aching rage\nHe made a demand of the machines
#diamond2 9

#"You who have not abandoned me\nI wish to become one of you"

In his foolish aching rage\nHe made a demand of the machines
cross8 13

"Tear out this broken heart of mine\nAnd build for me a heart of metal that will never fail"
triangle2 12

And so those loyal robots did as they were told
heart-build 17

And gifted him a heartless heart that could not feel, or love
diamond-large 5 3

And now he was alone\nbut did not know it.

#squareish 13 -- sidelined -- maybe patience-lite?
#triangle 11 -- sidelined -- too hard for the boy/girl/robot section -- maybe perfection?
#lonely 2 -- story end?
#funk 14 -- funky connections
#sharing2 7 -- same end as sides
#line-short2 12 -- boring solution?
#gap 16 -- boring solution?
#bond 10 -- kinda funky connections
#spirals 18 -- cool but hard to place
#simple2-horizontal 3 -- too easy to do by accident
#sizes 6 -- wants a more interesting puzzle
#
#string 11
#
# And grew lonely, as the boy toiled late into the nights, repairing robots
#
#corners 42 -- hard! 42 is my best but that's clearly not optimal
#diamond 18 -- hard
#cross 52 -- hard
#cross3 32 -- hard
#square2 12 -- hard!!!
#interesting 23 -- not aesthetically pleasing
#
#The boy sent robots to talk to the girl but she would turn them away
#chain 25 -- too boring?

#These might be interesting as perfection levels but they don't actually have to be perfect:
