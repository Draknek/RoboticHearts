Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once / was a young boy / and a young girl
isolated 3

They did not own much
two 5

But they were the best of friends
reckoner 4

And everything they had was shared between them
sides 8

They were always playing together, dancing through the trees
outsider-trees 7

#gift 7

#separated 10

Their friendship filling a hole that neither knew existed
hole 8

One day they found a broken robot in the woods
line-simpler 3

They worked hard to fix the robot
line 8

Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements
diagonals 12

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time
triangle4 6

And the robot marvelled at the love he saw blossom between the boy and the girl
bond 10

And watched the boy give his heart to the girl / As she gave hers to him
heart-swap 7

If only the story could have ended there...
triangle3 7

But the robot grew lonely, and one day the boy and the girl woke to find him gone
eyes3 9

They searched for any tracks he might have made
string-short 9

And followed him to the entrance of an abandoned factory
opensesame 10

Filled with broken down robots gathering dust
cross-simple 9

"Please," he said, "so few of these robots are still active"
cross2 7

"Cannot you fix them all?" he pleaded
ellipsis 10

And so they worked to repair the aging robots
placeholder 1

The task took weeks
cross7 7

And as the boy worked late into the nights, the girl grew lonely
cross4 9

And then weeks turned to months
cross7-harder 9

The boy's neglect of the girl broke her heart
heart-break2 5

And in her foolish aching rage / She made a demand of the machines
cross8 13

"Tear out this broken heart of mine / And build for me a heart of metal that will never fail"
triangle2 12

"His heart is for metal so metal I'll become"
placeholder 1

And so those loyal robots did as they were told
heart-build 17

And gifted her a heartless heart too hard for human love
diamond-large 5 3

Over to the boy she went / And he looked up from his work
sparse 10

With horror in his eyes he said "My love, what's this you've done?"
face 11

"This I did for you," she said
placeholder 1

He reached for her frozen face but she did not even smile
placeholder 1

He turned around and stalked off mad / Smashing robots who once had been friends
disperse3-easier 16

#disperse3 29

Gutting their wires and gears and springs / His purpose now was clear, his love was the stake
disperse4 35

He worked on for years / Making heart after heart
disperse2 24

But nothing he made could give back what was lost
placeholder 1

Now he's an old man with her young by his side
heart-break 3 4

Without hope for the future / Making hearts to this day

#The boy sent robots to talk to the girl but she would turn them away
