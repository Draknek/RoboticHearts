Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once / was a young boy / and a young girl
isolated 3

They did not own much
two 5

But they were the best of friends
reckoner 4

And everything they had was shared between them
gift 7

#sides 8
#gift 7
#separated 10

They were always playing together, dancing through the trees
outsider-trees 7

Their friendship filling a hole that neither knew existed
hole 8

One day they found a broken robot in the woods
line-simpler 3

They worked hard to fix the robot
line 8

Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements
diagonals 12

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time
triangle4 6

And the robot marvelled at the love he saw blossom between the boy and the girl
bond 10

And watched the boy give his heart to the girl / As she gave hers to him
heart-swap 7

If only their story could have been so simple...
triangle3 7

But the robot grew lonely, and one day the boy and the girl woke to find him gone
eyes3 9

They searched for any tracks he might have made
string-short 9

And followed him to the entrance of an abandoned factory
opensesame 11

Filled with broken down robots gathering dust
cross-simple 9

They ventured into the depths of the place
cross2 7

And the boy came to a decision: / "I shall fix them all!"
ellipsis 10

And so the boy worked to repair the aging robots
square4 7

The task took weeks
cross7 7

And as the boy worked late into the nights, the girl grew lonely
cross4-decrossed 9

And then weeks turned to months
cross7-harder 9

The boy's neglect of the girl broke her heart
heart-break2 5

And in her foolish aching rage / She made a demand of the machines
cross8-boxed 13

"Tear out this broken heart of mine / And build for me a heart of metal that will never fail"
heart-cross 11

"Metal's all he cares about so metal I'll become"
metal 15

And so those loyal robots gifted her / A heartless heart / Too hard for human love
heart-build 17

Over to the boy she went / And he looked up from his work
look-up 14

With horror in his eyes he said "My love, what's this you've done?"
face-easier 6

"This I did for you," she said / But her frozen face would not smile
face2 10

He turned around and stalked off mad / Smashing robots who'd once been friends
dismantle-three 39

Gutting their wires and gears and springs / His purpose now clear, to save her from her fate
disperse3-easier 15

He worked on for years / Making heart after heart
disperse2 24

But nothing he made could give back what was lost / Now he's an old man with her young by his side
old-young 6 8

Without hope for the future / Making hearts to this day
