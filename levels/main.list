Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once\nwas a young boy\nand a young girl
isolated 3

They were the best of friends
reckoner 4

And they danced together
simple2-simpler 4

And they played together
outsider 7

And for a brief time, they knew love
heart-simpler 6

But nothing is simple forever
simple3-simpler 9

And two lives are more complex than one
eyes 11

One day they found a broken robot in the woods
line 9

They worked hard to fix the robot
line3 6

Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements
diagonals 12

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time
line2-simpler 9

And the robot marvelled at the love he saw between the boy and the girl

Watching as the boy gave his heart to the girl\nAnd she gave hers to him
heart-swap 7

The robot became lonely and led them to his old home
cross-simple 16

"Please," he said, "so few of these robots are still active"
cross7 7

"Cannot you fix them all?" he pleaded

And so they worked to repair the aging robots

The task took weeks

And as the boy worked late into the nights, the girl grew lonely

And then weeks turned to months
cross4 9

And she felt lonelier still
heart-break2 5

And left him for another
heart-break 3 4

And suddenly the boy noticed her absence and found he was lonely too

In his foolish aching rage\nHe made a demand of the machines
diamond2 9

"You who have not abandoned me\nI wish to become one of you"
cross8 15

"Tear out this broken heart of mine\nAnd build for me a heart of metal that will never fail"
triangle2 12

And so those loyal robots did as they were told
heart-build 15

And gifted him a heartless heart that could not feel, or love
diamond-large 5 3

And now he was alone\nbut did not know it.
