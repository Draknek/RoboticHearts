Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once\nwas a young boy\nand a young girl
isolated 3

They were the best of friends
reckoner 4

And they danced together
simple2-simpler 4

And they played together
outsider 7

And for a brief time, they knew love
heart-simpler 6

But nothing is simple forever
simple3-simpler 9

And two lives are more complex than one
eyes 11

One day they found a broken robot in the woods

They worked hard to fix the robot

Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time

#And the robot marvelled at the love he saw between the boy and the girl

And he watched as the boy gave his heart to the girl\nAnd she gave hers to him
heart-swap 7

The robot became lonely and led them to his old home

"Please," he said, "so few of these robots are still active"

"Cannot you fix them all?" he pleaded

And so they worked to repair the aging robots

#The task took weeks

#And then months

#And over time the girl found she had grown tired of the robots

And she had also grown tired of the boy

And left him for another
heart-break 3 4

In his depression he threw himself into his work
squareish 13

#He thought only of the robots to be saved

Until finally there were no more robots left

And in return the robots worked hard to rebuild the boy's broken heart
heart-build 15

But something was missing

So they gifted him a heart of metal that would never fail

#A mechanical heart made by machines

#A heartless heart that would not love
