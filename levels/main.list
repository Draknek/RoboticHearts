Let me tell you a story...
simple 2

Once\nwas a young boy\nand a young girl
isolated 3

They did not own much
two 5

But everything they had was shared between them
gift 7

They were the best of friends
reckoner 4

Always playing together, dancing through the trees
outsider-trees 7

Their friendship filling a hole that neither knew existed
hole 8

One day they found a broken robot in the woods
line-simpler 3

They worked hard to fix the robot
line 8

Swapping its old rusty parts with gleaming new replacements
diagonals 12

And when he was fixed the trio played together for a time
triangle4 6

And the robot marvelled at the love he saw blossom between the boy and the girl
bond 9

And watched the boy give his heart to the girl\nAs she gave hers to him
heart-swap 7

If only the story could have ended there...
triangle3 7

But the robot grew lonely, and one day the boy and the girl woke to find him gone
eyes3 9

They searched for any tracks he might have made
string-short 9

And found him at the entrance to an abandoned factory
string 11

Filled with broken down robots gathering dust
cross-simple 9

"Please," he said, "so few of these robots are still active"
cross7 7

"Cannot you fix them all?" he pleaded
cross7-harder 9

And so they worked to repair the aging robots
cross2 7

The task took weeks
ellipsis 10

#And as the boy worked late into the nights, the girl grew lonely
#corner2 13

#And then weeks turned to months

And as the boy worked late into the nights, the girl grew lonely
cross4 9

The boy's neglect of the girl broke her heart
heart-break2 5

And she left him for another
heart-break 3 4

And suddenly the boy noticed her absence and found he was lonely too

#In his foolish aching rage\nHe made a demand of the machines
#diamond2 9

#"You who have not abandoned me\nI wish to become one of you"

In his foolish aching rage\nHe made a demand of the machines
cross8 13

"Tear out this broken heart of mine\nAnd build for me a heart of metal that will never fail"
triangle2 12

And so those loyal robots did as they were told
heart-build 17

And gifted him a heartless heart that could not feel, or love
diamond-large 5 3

And now he was alone\nbut did not know it.

#squareish 13 -- sidelined -- maybe patience-lite?
#triangle 11 -- sidelined -- too hard for the boy/girl/robot section -- maybe perfection?

#line-short2 12 -- boring solution?
#gap 16 -- boring solution?
#spirals 18 -- cool but hard to place
#simple2-horizontal 3 -- too easy to do by accident

#The boy sent robots to talk to the girl but she would turn them away
#chain 25 -- too boring?

#These might be interesting as perfection levels but they don't actually have to be perfect:
